Google Season of Docs supports documentation in open source by:

- Providing funds to open source organizations to use for documentation projects
- Providing guides and support for open source organizations to help them understand their documentation needs
- Collecting data from open source organizations to better understand documentation impact
- Publishing case studies from open source organizations to share best practices

Google Season of Docs seeks to empower open source organizations to understand their documentation needs, to create documentation to fill those needs, to measure the effect and impact of their documentation, and, in the spirit of open source, share what they've learned to help guide other projects. Google Season of Docs seeks to bring more technical writers into open source through funding their work with open source projects and organizations.
