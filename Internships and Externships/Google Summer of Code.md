Google Summer of Code is a global, online mentoring program focused on introducing new contributors to open source software development. GSoC contributors work on a 12+ week programming project with the guidance of mentors from their open source organization.

Since 2005, the Google Summer of Code program has connected 19,000+ new open source contributors from 112 countries with 18,000+ mentors from 133 countries. Google Summer of Code has produced over 43 million lines of code for 800+ open source organizations.

During Google Summer of Code, participating contributors are paired with mentors from open source organizations, gaining exposure to real-world software development techniques. Contributors will learn from experienced open source developers while writing code for real-world projects! A small stipend is provided as an incentive.

Participating organizations use the program to identify and bring in new, excited developers. Many of those new developers will continue to contribute to their new communities and open source long after GSoC is over.
