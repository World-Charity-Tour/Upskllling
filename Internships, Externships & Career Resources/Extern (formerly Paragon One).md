# Extern (formerly Paragon One)
Explore opportunities that give you work experience while building career exposure and skills for your resume. 

Extern’s mission is to help anyone discover and launch their career through professional experiences, available anywhere, at any time. Extern made this possible by inventing a new form of work experience with integrated learning – the remote Externship.

By design, the Externship was created to impact a universe of learners and organizations. To students, Externships are structured work experiences that are flexible and accessible. To companies, the Externship acts as a structured program that provides them with expert-led project teams doing meaningful work without the burden of the staffing, setup, and support. And to higher ed, Externships can be the work experience component to the curriculum meant to boost student job outcomes post graduation.

At Extern, we’re pioneering a new approach to work and learning, and we invite you to join us in establishing a best practice for transitioning student learners to professionals. We see Externships as a critical bridge between academic learning and professional achievement, fostering upward economic mobility.

Extern is backed by Foundation Capital, University Ventures, Learn Capital, Y Combinator and Jason Calacanis’ Launch Fund.
